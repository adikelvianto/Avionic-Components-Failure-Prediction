# Avionic Components Failure Prediction

This is my internship project at PT. GMF Aeroasia Tbk. In this project, i created a website to give failure prediction of VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) and Multimode Control Panel components, by using scikit-learn library, HTML, CSS and Flask. 

Aim of this porjects are: 
* Create and choose 3 best perform machine learning classification model on VOR component
* Create and choose 3 best perform machine learning classification model on Multimode Control Panel component. 
* Build simple prototype application on website to make it easier for maintenance technician inference result from every test.

This link show the website that i created in this project:
